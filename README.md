# Hexagon-and-Arrow-for-gmplot

During Spring 2018, I was involved in a research project in Transportation Analytics. I had to do some GPS data visualizations and especially had to plot figures (hexagons and arrows) using the amazing Python library [gmplot](https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot). This is a super easy package which enables you to draw GPS point representations, but unfortunately there is still no built-in functions for hexagons and arrows. <br>
I hope this can help you if you face the same problem !
